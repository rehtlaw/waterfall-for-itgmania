# Waterfall for ITGmania

### _Based on Waterfall Expanded 0.7.8 - theme originally by SteveReen_
### 

Please note this theme is in a pre-release state currently. We are working on it and will announce a release once it's ready. Please feel free to use it as-is until then. See the commit history for more details.

### This features general updates, bug fixes, performance improvements, an updated emoji set, and support for ITGmania specific features (visual delay, engine recalcs, etc)

Since I'm not expecting anyone else to really use this, I'm very much making this based on my setup, which is:

- latest ITGmania, often also on the beta branch
- 16:9
- 6 menu buttons (LDUR + Start and Select) with only dedicated buttons allowed
- always playing in Waterfall environment
- always needing 15ms FA+ for ITG scores

_This project is currently maintained by **sukibaby** and **rehtlaw**. We'd also like to thank everyone who contributed to Simply Love / Waterfall, especially as several features from Simply Love are being backported into this theme._

_This theme is specifically geared towards supporting the current build of ITGmania. It may still work on StepMania 5.0.12 / 5.1.0b2 / other SM5 forks to varying degrees, but we aren't testing those platforms._
