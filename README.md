# Waterfall for ITGmania

### _Based on Waterfall Expanded 0.7.8 - theme originally by SteveReen_
### 

# This is very much a hacky attempt at making WF Expanded usable in ITGmania made just for myself. Don't expect it to work well for you.

Since I'm not expecting anyone else to really use this, I'm very much making this based on my setup, which is:

- latest ITGmania, often also on the beta branch
- 16:9
- 6 menu buttons (LDUR + Start and Select) with only dedicated buttons allowed
- always playing in Waterfall environment
- always needing 15ms FA+ for ITG scores

### new changes in this version

- GrooveStats and BoogieStats support, including downloading unlocks
- Recalcs mostly work (they're not counted yet so you don't see recalcs on the eval screen, but the lifebar works as it should with them)
- ITL/SRPG overlay is up-to-date
- quick-reload works together with the Hash Cache
- judgetilt multiplier with 0.1 steps
- remove some of the gimmick mods from WF Expanded
- added a few more judgefonts
- make the error bar not tilt with the judgment
- change button layout to scroll with UD and change difficulty with LR
- move difficulties down and rotate them to be horizontal
- add Peak NPS/eBPM to the chart description
- use the new tech parser values
